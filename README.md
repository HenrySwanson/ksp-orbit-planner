# KSP Orbit Planner

Trying to make a tool to help me plan orbital maneuvers better. Dunno when the last time I actually
played KSP was though -- I might've spent more time on this recently than the actual game.

Right now it just simulates the Kerbol system, and there's no concept of a ship, just celestial
bodies.

Controls
- Q and E: switch focused body
- Comma and Period: slow down and speed up time
- R: reverse direction of time
- P: pause/unpause
- Esc: quit
